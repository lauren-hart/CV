Thank you for taking the time to have a look at my Git Hub profile!

All of the pinned repositories on my Github overview are examples of group projects I was a part of during my time at Enspiral Dev Academy's bootcamp programme.

If you like what you see, please check out my CV (feel free to download a copy).
